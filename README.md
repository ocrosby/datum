Creating a virtual environment

```bash
python3 -m venv /path/to/virtual/directory
```

Activating the virtual environment

Let's say you created a virtual directory named venv as follows

```bash
> python3 -m venv venv
```

In order to activate the virtual environment source the activate script

```bash
> . venv/bin/activate
```

At this point you should see (venv) or whatever you named your virtual environment directory
to the left of the shell prompt.

To deactivate a virtual environment 

```bash
> deactivate
```

Installing dependencies using requirements.txt

```bash
> pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```
