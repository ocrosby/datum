# Improved Event-Driven Architecture (EDA)

## Overview

The improved architecture introduces several key enhancements to make the system more decoupled and scalable:

1. **Event Sourcing** - Complete audit trail of all events
2. **Domain-Specific Event Buses** - Separate event streams for different domains
3. **Saga Pattern** - Complex workflow orchestration with compensation
4. **Event Handlers** - Decoupled event processing
5. **Event Publisher** - Centralized event publishing

## Architecture Components

### 1. Event Store
```
aws_dynamodb_table.event_store
├── aggregate_id (Hash Key)
├── event_id (Range Key)
├── event_type
├── timestamp
├── data (Event payload)
└── version
```

**Benefits:**
- Complete audit trail
- Event replay capability
- Temporal queries
- Data consistency

### 2. Event Buses
```
aws_cloudwatch_event_bus.main          # General events
aws_cloudwatch_event_bus.soccer_events # Match/team events
aws_cloudwatch_event_bus.calculation_events # RPI calculation events
aws_cloudwatch_event_bus.metadata_events # Team metadata events
```

**Benefits:**
- Domain isolation
- Independent scaling
- Selective event processing
- Reduced coupling

### 3. Event Publisher
Centralized service for publishing events to both event store and event buses.

**Features:**
- Event envelope creation
- Event sourcing integration
- Multi-bus publishing
- Error handling

### 4. Event Handlers
Domain-specific handlers for processing events:

- **MatchEventHandler** - Processes match-related events
- **CalculationEventHandler** - Processes calculation events
- **MetadataEventHandler** - Processes metadata events

### 5. Saga Coordinator
Orchestrates complex workflows with compensation:

**Saga Steps:**
1. Collect Matches
2. Calculate RPI
3. Publish Results
4. Update Cache

**Compensation:**
- Rollback mechanisms for each step
- Automatic compensation on failure
- Saga state tracking

## Event Flow

### 1. Match Collection Flow
```
Match Collector → Event Publisher → Soccer Events Bus → Match Event Handler → DynamoDB
```

### 2. RPI Calculation Flow
```
Saga Coordinator → Collect Matches → Calculate RPI → Publish Results → Update Cache
```

### 3. Metadata Update Flow
```
Team Metadata Manager → Event Publisher → Metadata Events Bus → Metadata Event Handler → DynamoDB
```

## Benefits of Improved Architecture

### 1. **Decoupling**
- Services communicate only through events
- No direct dependencies between components
- Independent deployment and scaling
- Technology agnostic

### 2. **Scalability**
- Event buses can scale independently
- Lambda functions auto-scale based on event volume
- Horizontal scaling of event handlers
- Partitioned event processing

### 3. **Reliability**
- Event sourcing provides complete audit trail
- Saga pattern ensures data consistency
- Compensation handles failures gracefully
- Event replay for recovery

### 4. **Observability**
- Complete event history
- Saga state tracking
- Event processing metrics
- Failure monitoring

### 5. **Extensibility**
- Easy to add new event types
- New handlers can subscribe to existing events
- Domain-specific event buses
- Pluggable event processors

## Implementation Details

### Event Structure
```json
{
  "event_id": "uuid",
  "event_type": "MatchCreated",
  "aggregate_id": "match_123",
  "timestamp": "2024-01-01T00:00:00Z",
  "data": {
    "match_id": "123",
    "home_team": "Team A",
    "away_team": "Team B",
    "score": "2-1"
  },
  "version": "1.0"
}
```

### Saga Structure
```json
{
  "saga_id": "uuid",
  "saga_type": "rpi_calculation",
  "status": "in_progress",
  "data": {
    "calculation_date": "2024-01-01",
    "date_range": "2024-01-01/2024-01-31"
  },
  "steps": [
    {
      "step_name": "collect_matches",
      "status": "completed",
      "compensation_function": "rollback_matches"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Deployment Considerations

### 1. **Event Store Scaling**
- Use DynamoDB on-demand billing
- Monitor event volume and size
- Implement event archiving strategy

### 2. **Event Bus Configuration**
- Configure appropriate event retention
- Set up dead letter queues
- Monitor event processing latency

### 3. **Saga Management**
- Implement saga timeout handling
- Set up saga monitoring and alerting
- Configure compensation retry logic

### 4. **Event Handler Scaling**
- Configure Lambda concurrency limits
- Monitor event processing performance
- Implement circuit breakers

## Monitoring and Alerting

### 1. **Event Metrics**
- Event publishing rate
- Event processing latency
- Event processing errors
- Event store size

### 2. **Saga Metrics**
- Saga completion rate
- Saga failure rate
- Compensation execution rate
- Saga duration

### 3. **Event Handler Metrics**
- Handler invocation count
- Handler error rate
- Handler duration
- Handler concurrency

## Future Enhancements

### 1. **Event Streaming**
- Consider Amazon Kinesis for high-volume events
- Implement event partitioning
- Add event ordering guarantees

### 2. **CQRS Pattern**
- Separate read and write models
- Implement event sourcing projections
- Add read model optimization

### 3. **Event Versioning**
- Implement event schema evolution
- Add event migration strategies
- Handle backward compatibility

### 4. **Event Replay**
- Implement event replay capabilities
- Add event replay monitoring
- Support partial event replay

This improved architecture provides a solid foundation for building scalable, maintainable, and reliable event-driven systems.
